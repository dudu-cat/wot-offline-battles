"""Canonical pose commit for locally constructed 0.8.2 vehicle proxies.

The offline battle has more consumers than the rendered model: the minimap and
markers read ``mock.matrix``, native entity users read ``entity.filter``, and
the chassis is normally driven by ``Servo(mock.matrix)``.  Updating any one of
those in isolation creates a split pose.  Keep all live-vehicle pose writes in
this small adapter; wreck models deliberately own a separate frozen matrix.
