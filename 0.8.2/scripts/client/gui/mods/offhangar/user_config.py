'''Compatibility shim for the internal-layout modules.

Those modules came from a separate build of this mod that keeps its user-owned
files behind a `user_config` API. This mod already has one - paths.py, with the
same `offhangar_user/` directory - so the shim maps their three entry points
onto it instead of introducing a second user-data location.

Kept deliberately small and stdlib-only: paths.py sits at the bottom of the
import graph and nothing here may pull BigWorld in.
